## :question: What is this Repository about?

This project is the outcome of my self-learning the API Testing Automation frameworks - Rest-assured and OkHttp.
I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and OkHttp and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests in an efficient way.
  
Hence, I started learning about these frameworks and have documented all my learnings in this repository.

Checkout my blog [API Testing using RestAssured and OkHttp](https://mfaisalkhatri.github.io/2020/05/29/restassuredokhttp/) where I talk about these frameworks in details 
and which one to choose for testing your APIs.


## Details about this Project:

- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured and OkHttp.
- Hamcrest Matchers and TestNG asserts are used for assertions.
- TestNG Listeners are used to capture the events in log.
- Log4j is used to capture logs.
- Lombok has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
- Rest APIs on https://reqres.in/ have been used for testing.
